## Code of Conduct
(According to Sage)
1. How can a student contact me? They can email you, they must CC the SAGE email address. 
2. What if a student sends me an email and doesn't CC the SAGE email address? Send your reply with the SAGE email address in the CC field. 
3. What if a student follows me on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc)? That is OK, but do not follow their social media accounts. 
4. What if a student sends me a message on social media? Do not reply on social media. Instead, send them an email and CC the SAGE email address.
